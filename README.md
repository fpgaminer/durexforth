# durexforth

Modern, lean C64 Forth inspired by colorForth, JONESFORTH and Blazin' Forth. Project includes a vi clone written in Forth, a high-resolution graphics library, plus MML music support (new in 1.3!).

Goals (in order of priority):

* Fun. The system should be nice to work with on the real machine.
* Simplicity. The core should be small, leaving a lot of space for user code and data.
* Speed. durexForth should be at least as fast as Blazin' Forth.

Non-goals:

* Being the fastest possible C64 Forth. Subroutine-threading would certainly be faster, but the durexForth way is to first write correct code in Forth, then hand-optimize crucial words using the inbuilt assembler.
