# durexforth

Modern, lean C64 Forth inspired by colorForth, JONESFORTH and Blazin' Forth. Project includes a vi clone written in Forth, a high-resolution graphics library, plus MML music support (new in 1.3!).

Goals (in order of priority):

* Fun. The system should be nice to work with on the real machine.
* Simplicity. The core should be small, leaving a lot of space for user code and data.
* Speed. durexForth should be at least as fast as Blazin' Forth.

Non-goals:

* Being the fastest C64 Forth. durexForth could probably be made four times faster, but only at the cost of increased code size and complexity. I believe pursuing this is a red herring; it is better to prototype in Forth and then rewrite crucial parts in assembly. For that purpose, durexForth includes an assembler.
